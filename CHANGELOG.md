# task_batch_integration 2.0.0

A major update to the OpenProblems framework, switching from a Python-based framework to a Viash + Nextflow-based framework. This update features the same concepts as the previous version, but with a new implementation that is more flexible, scalable, and maintainable.

## Migration

* Added expected input/output interfaces in `src/api` and document them in `README.md`.

* Store common resources used across tasks in a git submodule `common`.

* Methods, metrics, workflows and other components are implemented as Viash components with a per-component Docker image.

## New functionality

* Added SCimilarity (PR #3).

* Added Geneformer (PR #6).

* Added UCE method (PR #7).

* Added scGPT zero shot (PR #8, #16).

* Added scPRINT (PR #13).

* Added scGPT fine-tuned (PR #17).


## Major changes
