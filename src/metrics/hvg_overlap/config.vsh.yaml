      summary: Overlap of highly variable genes per batch before and after integration.
      # TODO: transform into more readable markdown with proper formulae formatting
      description: |
        The HVG conservation score is a proxy for the preservation of
        the biological signal. If the data integration method returned
        a corrected data matrix, we computed the number of HVGs before
        and after correction for each batch via Scanpy's
        highly_variable_genes function (using the 'cell ranger' flavor).
        If available, we computed 500 HVGs per batch. If fewer than 500
        genes were present in the integrated object for a batch,
        the number of HVGs was set to half the total genes in that batch.
        The overlap coefficient is as follows:
        overlap(𝑋,𝑌)=|𝑋∩𝑌|/min(|𝑋|,|𝑌|),

        where X and Y denote the fraction of preserved informative genes.
        The overall HVG score is the mean of the per-batch HVG overlap
        coefficients.
