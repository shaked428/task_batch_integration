      label: Graph Connectivity
      summary: Connectivity of the subgraph per cell type label
      # TODO: transform into more readable markdown with proper formulae formatting
      description: |
        The graph connectivity metric assesses whether the kNN graph representation,
        G, of the integrated data directly connects all cells with the same cell
        identity label. For each cell identity label c, we created the subset kNN
        graph G(Nc;Ec) to contain only cells from a given label. Using these subset
        kNN graphs, we computed the graph connectivity score using the equation:

        gc =1/|C| Σc∈C |LCC(G(Nc;Ec))|/|Nc|.

        Here, C represents the set of cell identity labels, |LCC()| is the number
        of nodes in the largest connected component of the graph, and |Nc| is the
        number of nodes with cell identity c. The resultant score has a range
        of (0;1], where 1 indicates that all cells with the same cell identity
        are connected in the integrated kNN graph, and the lowest possible score
        indicates a graph where no cell is connected. As this score is computed
        on the kNN graph, it can be used to evaluate all integration outputs.
