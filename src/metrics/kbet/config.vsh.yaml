      summary: kBET algorithm to determine how well batches are mixed within a cell

      description: |
        The kBET algorithm (v.0.99.6, release 4c9dafa) determines whether the label composition
        of a k nearest neighborhood of a cell is similar to the expected (global) label
        composition (Buettner et al., Nat Meth 2019). The test is repeated for a random subset
        of cells, and the results are summarized as a rejection rate over all tested
        neighborhoods. Thus, kBET works on a kNN graph.

        We compute kNN graphs where k = 50 for joint embeddings and corrected feature outputs
        via Scanpy preprocessing steps. To test for technical effects and to account for
        cell-type frequency shifts across datasets, we applied kBET
        separately on the batch variable for each cell identity label. Using the kBET defaults,
        a k equal to the median of the number of cells per batch within each label is used for
        this computation. Additionally, we set the minimum and maximum thresholds of k to 10 and
        100, respectively. As kNN graphs that have been subset by cell identity labels may no
        longer be connected, we compute kBET per connected component. If >25% of cells were
        assigned to connected components too small for kBET computation (smaller than k × 3),
        we assigned a kBET score of 1 to denote poor batch removal. Subsequently, kBET scores
        for each label were averaged and subtracted from 1 to give a final kBET score.

        In Open Problems we do not run kBET on graph outputs to avoid computation-intensive
        diffusion processes being run.
